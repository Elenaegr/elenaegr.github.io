									Conversational agents and social robots are becoming increasingly popular the last decade. 
									In order for these units to make their way into our everyday life, they have to function 
									at a social level similar to humans. Interactions between humans are complex and include 
									many subtle cues that we take for granted. When developing a robotic partner, these things 
									have to be integrated into the system in order for us to perceive these agents as sociable, 
									intelligent partners.

									This project investigates the effect of the physical embodiment of the agent and how differently 
									embodied agents are perceived by their human users in terms of social presence. Two different conversational 
									agents were used for the study: Amazon Echo (left picture) and Furhat robot (right picture). Furhat was at the same time configured in two modes: 
									a heuristic eye-gaze model where the robot would follow the user's moves with its eyes and moving its head, and a static model where the robot
									would stay static throughout the developing of the task.

							</div>
							<p class="justified">In order for us to study the physical embodiment effect, subjects (N=30) were given 
								the task of cooking different recipees with the help of the different agents. They were encouraged to 
								interact with the robot/speaker while following their instructions.
								After each task, each subject filled out a social presence questionnaire from where we evaluated the results. 
								The results from the questionnaire shows significant difference between 
								Amazon Echo and Furhat in terms of social presence. The conclusion is that physical 
								embodiment does have an impact on the perceived social presence, 
								but at some level of embodiment the difference becomes smaller as 
								Furhat with gaze shift showed no significance difference with the static one. 
								Our findings indicate that it is not always favorable for agents to be anthropomorphised or to
								communicate with non-verbal cues. We found a trade-off between task performance 
								and perceived sociability when controlling for anthropomorphism and social behavior.
