								<p>The traditional memory game adapted to haptics</p>
								<h2>Haptic Memory Game</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="box alt">
								<p class="justified">The Haptic Memory game is the project resulting from the course Haptic, Tactile, 
									and Tangible Interaction of the Master’s Interactive Media Technology at KTH. This project aims to answer the research question "How difficult is shape recognition 
									with haptic devices?" by the use of a memory game adapted to a haptic device. In order to 
									understand the game, two different concepts are explained: <b>haptic perception</b> and <b>haptic device</b>.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p class="justified">Haptic perception is defined as the perception in which both the cutaneous sense and 
								the kinesthesis convey significant information about distal objects and events. Moreover, haptic devices are devices
								designed in a way that they apply resistance and forces via motors in the joints of a robotic arm. The resistance 
								is applied based on the surface of a graphical object when the proxy of the device is virtually placed 
								on it.
							</p>
							<p class="justified">Haptic devices' applications could vary from an astronaut teleoperating 
								a robot outside the International Space Station to a surgeon using a robot to perform a delicate 
								procedure at a scale not achievable with the human hand or in training where the trainee person 
								learns by trial and error method and this cannot be done directly in real scenarios such us humans 
								or factories. For the previous situations, the help of a haptic device is really 
								valuable since they give to the person operating them the sense of “telepresence”. The 
								operator basically feels as if he or she is directly manipulating the environment with their own hands.
							</p>
							<p class="justified">For the Haptic Memory Game project a Phantom Omni has been used. It is a commercial, 
								portable haptic device with six Degrees of Freedom. The workspace of the Phantom Omni is 
								16 cm x 12 cm x 7 cm (W x H x D) and can be provide force feedback up to 3.3 N.

								</div>
							</div>
							<p class="justified">The game itself has been developed as an adaptation to the traditional memory game where 
								the player/s have to match the cards by peers based on the image drawn on them. In the Haptic Memory Game, 
								the user has to match the shapes hidden in boxes by hapticly feeling them. The game has been 
								developed using the open source haptic framework <a href="https://www.chai3d.org/" target="_blank">Chai3D</a> 
								and the shapes chosen for the study to be recognized are the sphere, the cylinder, the cube and the torus.

									<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/haptic/game3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p class="justified">When the player achieves to haptically match two shapes, the boxes hiding the 
								shapes are automatically deleted as an analogy for the real game where the player leaves 
								the cards right-side up. The game is over when the user achieves to match all the shapes with 
								their own pairs. 
							</p>
							<p class="justified">At the end of the game, each participant had to complete a questionnaire whose 
								solutions show that the sphere is the easier shape to recognize, then the cylinder followed by 
								the cube and finally the torus.
